             <th class = "information" style = "width: 75%; vertical-align: center;">I am a senior pursuing ECE at the University of Washington, Seattle, with Digital Signal Processing as my concentration and a Minor in Neural Engineering. I have also participated in a Training program in Neural Computation and Engineering. I joined Synaptech as a Freshmen to learn more about Brain and Neuroengineering. The club helped me reach out to Seniors and Professors in the field and learn about their research. I took over as President in my sophomore year and have worked on various projects in the last couple of years. My team and I have worked on numerous projects involving EEG, EMG, TENS, and Muse headsets and hacked them to make assistive devices for tetraplegic patients. Our most significant success was when we were able to hack Muse headband to map eye blinks to key presses. We used the chrome dino game (where the input was a spacebar) as a proof of concept to demonstrate remapping of eye blinks to keys. I am really passionate about Brain-Computer Interfaces and would love to contribute to this growing field.</th>

               <th class = "information" style = "width: 75%; vertical-align: center;">I joined Synaptech because I wanted to work on cool projects around neurotech with others. We made so many cool things, but I particularly enjoyed playing a Tron game collaboratively, where I controlled left/right with my arms and another person controlled up/down.
